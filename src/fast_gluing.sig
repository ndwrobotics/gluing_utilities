S,InvariantsFromHCoordinates,"Takes as input a period matrix representing the product of a genus 1 and genus 2 curve, a 6-dimensional vector space V over F_ell, a 4-dimensional subspace VY of V, a point a in P3(F_ell), and a field F. Returns a list of invariants of potential ell-gluings of the two curves which use the coordinates of a as a generator for H and whose invariants are defined over the field F. (The optional parameters ""index"" and ""total"" are only used to control console output.)",0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-24,,0,0,377,,0,0,159,,0,0,159,,0,0,155,,-1,-38,-38,-38,-38,-38
S,AllGeometricGluingsCCEfficient,"Finds all possible gluings of the genus 1 curve X1 and the genus 2 curve X2 along ell-torsion, with invariants defined over F. If the algorithm fails to identify H, hprec should be increased. If the algorithm failes to algebraize invariants, the precision of F should be increased",0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,148,,0,0,-24,,0,0,371,,0,0,371,,-1,-38,-38,-38,-38,-38
